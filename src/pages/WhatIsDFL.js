				<h2>What Is Discord Fight League?</h2>
				<div className="articleDescription">
					<ul>
						<li>
							Discord Fight League (DFL) is a social competitive mixed martial
							arts (MMA) league that awards players for accurate fight result
							prediction.
						</li>
						<li>
							DFL is the ultimate proving grounds to test your knowledge and
							understanding of MMA against other MMA fans.
						</li>
						<li>
							DFL requires no signup process and is completely free to play.
							Simply use your existing Discord account to start competing.
						</li>
						<li>
							DFL is a social hub where players may discuss MMA related news,
							betting strategies, and world events.
						</li>
						<li>
							DFL is a fun and healthy substitute to gambling - where bragging
							rights and divisional ranking are the ultimate prize.
						</li>
						<li>
							DFL is an adult social community where freedom of thought and
							expression are not impeded on. Think of DFL like you would your
							neighborhood sports bar. We do ask that users abide by Discord's
							Terms of Service and use good taste when interacting with our
							community.
						</li>
						<li>
							We currently exclusively follow UFC events. As popularity in DFL
							increases, we may begin to follow other combat sports promotions.
						</li>
						<li>
							DFL is a league that is divided up into divisions. Competitive
							difficulty increases with each advancement into the next division.
							Players can expect increased difficulty ranking up to the next
							tier as they progress through the competitive ladder.
						</li>
						<li>
							Our seasons last one calendar month. At the end of each season,
							players will be either promoted to a higher division, remain in
							their current division, or will be placed in a lower division.
							These placements will be decided based on the player's
							end-of-season ranking within their division.
						</li>
						<li>
							Our seasons are divided up into Rounds. A Round occurs whenever
							there is a UFC fight card occuring in the upcoming weekend.
						</li>
						<li>
							Our Elite division represents the league's 10 best players. At the
							end of each season, the 3 best players from the Masters division
							will be swapped out for the 3 worst players from the Elite
							division.
						</li>
						<li>
							Players can earn championship belts for placing first in their
							division at the end of each season. These accolades will be
							viewable to the public.
						</li>
